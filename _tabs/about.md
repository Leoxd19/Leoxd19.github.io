> Hi there 🏄

 As an avid computer science student, I'm driven by my passion for programming and technology.

 My journey is fueled by a relentless curiosity to explore cutting-edge tech and contribute to innovative solutions. I'm eager to apply my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact in our ever-evolving world.

 In addition to my technical pursuits, I find inspiration and draw influence from the arts, literature and philosophy. Some of my favorite thinkers include Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Sir Martin Rees, Sean Carroll, George Orwell, Spinoza, Voltaire, Marcus Aurelius, Leonardo Da Vinci & Michelangelo.

 Among my favorite artworks are 'Nighthawks' by Edward Hopper and 'The Night Before the Exam' by Leonid Osipovich Pasternak. These pieces resonate with me deeply, reflecting my appreciation for the intersection of creativity and skill.
