 As an avid computer science student, I'm driven by my passion for programming and technology.

 My journey is fueled by a curiosity to explore pioneering tech and contribute to innovative solutions. I'm eager to apply my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact in our ever-evolving world.

 In addition to my technical pursuits, I find inspiration and draw influence from the arts, literature and philosophy. 
 
 Some of my favorite thinkers include; Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Sir Martin Rees, Sean Carroll, George Orwell, Spinoza, Voltaire & Marcus Aurelius.
